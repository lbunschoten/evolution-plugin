	This graph will also calculate the scores for each individual build, but displays the derivative of the line instead of the actual scores. This graph can be particularly useful for bigger projects.<br />

	This graph <strong>requires at least 20 successful builds</strong>. Each build should provide data for the evolution calculations.
